## Description
The goal of this project is to provide a portable, discreet, and extensible mobile reconnaissance platform for on-premises penetration testing. This is accomplished using a frontend android application to configure and initiate commands on a Raspberry Pi running a backend application.
Requirements:
- All commands will be initiated by a mobile phone. What's more discreet, someone pulling out a laptop in your lobby or someone checking some emails on their phone?
- Size will be minimized. Most tasks can be run off a laptop in a backpack, but I want this project to be pocket-sized.
- Data gathered by tools should be viewable on the phone.
- Proxy mobile phone traffic to preserve anonymity.
